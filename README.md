# akstorytowiki

A simple CLI tool to convert Arknights story files to the format used by the
[Arknights Terra Wiki](https://arknights.wiki.gg).

This CLI aims to help as much as possible but sadly an amount of manual editing
might still be required. It should at least however do the major heavy-lifting
of transcribing all of the text from the game.

## Usage

```sh
$ akstorytowiki arknights-story-file-name.txt > output.txt
```

You can find the Arknights story files on [Kengxxiao](https://github.com/Kengxxiao/ArknightsGameData_YoStar/tree/main/en_US/gamedata/story/activities)'s
GitHub repository.
